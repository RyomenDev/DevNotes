### 🚀 Step 1: Initialize the Next.js Project

✅ Requirements:
Node.js (latest LTS recommended)

MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)

Code editor (VS Code recommended)

🛠️ 1. Create a Next.js App

```bash
Edit
npx create-next-app@latest app-name
cd app-name
```

### 📦 2. Install Required Packages

**Next.js works like React — in fact, it’s built on top of React.**

## 🔄 Live Reload / Hot Reloading

When you're running the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

✅ Any changes you make in your code (like components, pages, styles) will automatically update in the browser.

✅ You don't need to manually refresh — just like in React with Create React App (CRA), it auto-reloads.

| Feature    | CRA                       | Next.js                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Routing    | Manual using React Router | Built-in file-based routing        |
| SSR/SSG    | Not available             | ✅ Built-in (optional per page)    |
| API Routes | Not available             | ✅ Built-in serverless API support |
| SEO        | Basic                     | ✅ Better SEO with SSR/SSG         |

**Next.js, the structure is a bit different from Create React App — but once you get used to it, it's actually simpler and more powerful.**

## 🚀 Starting Point in Next.js

✅ 1. No index.html
Next.js does not use a traditional index.html file like CRA.

Instead, it handles the HTML automatically using its server-side engine.

✅ 2. Entry Point: app/page.tsx or pages/index.js
Depending on how you created your app (using the new app directory or the traditional pages directory), here's what to look for:

| Folder   | Starting File                    | Explanation                                                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `app/`   | `app/page.tsx` or `app/page.jsx` | **New app router** (recommended by Next.js) — this is your main homepage |
| `pages/` | `pages/index.js`                 | Traditional Next.js routing — still works well                           |

## 🌐 Routing System

If you create a file:

app/about/page.tsx → it will be served at yourdomain.com/about

pages/contact.js → it will be served at yourdomain.com/contact

## 📁 In Summary:

| Task                            | CRA                    | Next.js (App Router)               |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Main HTML file                  | `public/index.html`    | Handled internally by Next.js      |
| Main JS/TS file                 | `src/index.js`         | `app/page.tsx` or `pages/index.js` |
| Component rendering starts from | `ReactDOM.render(...)` | Handled by Next.js automatically   |
